      <p>The activated carbon has several properties one of which is
        being highly porous in nature. Carbon atoms are used to make the complex
        structure of activated carbon. The combination of rigid skeletons which is
        connected with chemical bonds in order to make a porous structure is known as
        activated carbon. </p>

      <img src="/blog/activated-carbon-waste.png" alt="Activated Carbon Waste"
        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

      <p>Activated carbon is not extracted from a single source. Rather, it has several sources such as soft woods,
        coconut
        shells, lignite coal, etc. Several ranges of activated carbons are used for different purpose. One of the
        wonderful
        uses of <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/">activated carbon</a> is removal of the impurities from
        water. It
        is also used in sewage treatment. The form of carbon not only removes the organic impurities, rather it will
        also
        remove chlorine from water. </p>

      <p>The toxic gases are also removed with the help of the
        activated carbon. This is very well utilized in greenhouses in order to remove
        the harmful air particles, dust particles, etc completely from the surroundings
        where the greeneries starts spouting.</p>

      <p><strong>Market Overview Of
          Activated Carbon</strong></p>

      <p>The demand of activated carbon is increasing in the market
        due to number of reasons. In the year 2016-2020 the demand for the product is
        not too high. But, it has increased to 9.3% in few years. It is also expected
        to give the business of $5,129 million by 2022.</p>

      <p>The need of the activated carbon is increasing in water
        purification and treatment industry. Our environment is captured by the harmful
        pollutants. Thus, the application of activated carbon cans also contribution
        with the boost in industrialization and urbanization.</p>

      <p><strong>Projects Getting Profits From Activated Carbon</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Extraction of activated carbon from
            coconut shell</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>The amorphous form of carbon is named as activated carbon. This gives
        rise to highly developed porous structure which also comes with a big internal
        surface area. The feature of absorbing gases and vapours comes from pore
        structure of the activated carbon. Yes, the shell of coconut is widely used to
        extract the activated carbon. This in turn helps in making sugar refined,
        produces electrodes and purifies water.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;<strong>Bamboo for activated carbon</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Can you imagine that activated carbon can also remain in bamboo? Being the non graphite form of carbon, the <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/services.html">activated carbon</a> has the
        microcrystalline
        nature. Bamboo is used to extract the activated carbon for the need of solvent extraction, manufacture rayon in
        fabric
        industry, chemical treatment, water treatment, etc.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Activated carbon from saw dust</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Carbon itself is widely used in various industries and factories. But,
        that carbon that has higher absorption capacities as compared to wood or
        charcoal is the activated charcoal. You can get the activated carbons in many
        forms. Some of them are in the form of pellets, fine powder as well as
        granules. The saw dust is one of the main sources of activated carbon. </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Activated carbon from jute sticks</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The activated carbon is extracted from the several carbonaceous particles. One of them is jute sticks. The
        natural
        extracts can give you a wonderful form of activated carbon. There will be no addition of the bonding agents.</p>

      <p> Thus, the prospect of <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">activated
          carbon</a> is
        quite high in market. The uses of the product are diverse along with the ease of production. Just with the
        natural
        resources that are getting wasted such as coconut shell, saw dust, etc, activated carbon can be manufactured.
