        <p><strong>Activated carbon has multifarious uses. Know how you can use<br> activated carbon for getting the
            desired
            result in water treatments. </strong></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Activated carbon is definitely one of the most useful materials in the industrial sector. It is used for the
        purpose
        of detoxification, for combating bad odor as well as for water treatment. As they are always in high demand, <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/">activated carbon</a> is nowadays available in as granules and fine
        powder.
        So let’s have a closer look at how activated carbon or charcoal can be used for water treatment in both
        commercial and
        industrial sections. </p>

        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

      <p><strong>Importance of Water
          Treatment</strong></p>

      <p>The whole purpose of water treatment is to make sure that
        all kinds of impurities are extracted from water so that it can be made safe
        for regular human consumption. In circumstances where pure and clean water is
        rare, it is very important to make use of water treatment as this can help
        people of all ages to drink clean water and stay healthy. As pollution is a
        major problem in the modern world, it can be difficult for people to get clean
        water readily that they can use for drinking. Therefore it is vitally important
        to make use of activated carbon in such cases as it can help in purifying
        water. The unique properties of activated carbon can help in filtrating water
        and it is even more effective than traditional methods of filtration. Activated
        carbon is now regarded as one of the most pocket friendly ways to remove
        contaminants from the water. It can also help to eradicate bad smell that may
        be present in the drinking water.</p>

      <p><strong>The Functions of
          Activated Carbon </strong></p>

      <p>The main reason for which activated carbon is used to treat water is that activated charcoal can serve as a
        powerful
        adsorbent, thus getting rid of unwanted organics and particles from unclean water. The process of removing these
        particles is achieved when they get bound to the <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/services.html">activated carbon</a> particles through physical
        or chemical attraction. In many ways, this is the best method of removing germs and undesired particles from the
        water
        as otherwise they can react with disinfectants like chlorine and give rise to new byproducts. Such byproducts
        can also
        lead to cancer or maybe even fatal when they are consumed. Therefore it can be said that activated charcoal can
        be a
        great way to maintain human health at a very affordable price. </p>

      <p><strong>Adsorption Process Associated With Water Treatment</strong> </p>

      <p>The distinct feature of adsorption is what makes activated carbon perfect for water treatment. For this reason,
        <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">activated carbon</a> is used in homes as well as large
        factories for water purification. The process of purification is carried out in three different steps. During
        the
        first step, all unwanted particles get adsorbed to the outer surface of carbon granules. The particles then move
        to
        the carbon pores. The final step involves complete adsorption of particles to interior walls of activated
        charcoal or
        carbon. This gives rise to clean, drinkable water. Using activated carbon for water purification is also very
        simple
        and it is for this reason that this process is widely accepted.
