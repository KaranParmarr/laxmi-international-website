        <article class="post-content">
            <p>Activated carbon is one of the most effective filtration media used in modern water treatment systems.
                Its performance is rooted in adsorption, a process where contaminants adhere to its internal porous
                surface. These pores, formed through high-temperature activation, create a massive surface area capable
                of removing chlorine, tastes, odours, organic chemicals, and industrial impurities. This is why
                activated carbon is a crucial element in municipal, commercial, and industrial water purification.</p>

            <p>In water treatment plants, granular activated carbon (GAC) is typically used in fixed-bed filters due to
                its ability to withstand continuous flow. Its pore structure captures dissolved organic matter and
                chemical residues, improving water clarity and safety. Laxmi International supplies GAC grades
                engineered specifically for long bed life, uniform particle size, and reduced pressure drop, ensuring
                optimal filtration performance in a variety of plant configurations.</p>

                style="width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:15px;">

            <p>Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is used when rapid treatment is needed. It is added directly to the water
                stream and acts quickly, making it ideal for seasonal contamination, emergency treatment, or
                taste-and-odor issues. Laxmi International offers PAC with high surface area and fast adsorption
                kinetics, helping facilities respond effectively to sudden changes in raw water quality.</p>

            <p>Whether used in municipal drinking water systems, wastewater treatment plants, or industrial filtration
                units, activated carbon remains essential for safeguarding public health. Through its high adsorption
                capacity and proven reliability, it continues to be the backbone of effective water purification.</p>
