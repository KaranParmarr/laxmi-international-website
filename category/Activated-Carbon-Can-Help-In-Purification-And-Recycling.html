      <p>The world is always going through a lot of changes and in
        the recent times we have seen transformations at a totally unprecedented rate
        which have touched all aspects of human life. Newer technologies and working
        methods are being introduced with every passing day and they are changing the
        way we use different kinds of resources. The rapid growth of population has
        also affected the way we use water and fuel as well as numerous forms of
        chemicals. Unless we have sufficient amount of natural resources, it can make
        things really difficult for us. Wastage of resources like water can also result
        in pollution and surplus costs. &nbsp;</p>

      <img src="/blog/activated-carbon-recycle.png" alt="Activated Carbon Recycle"
        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

      <p><strong>How Recycling And
          Purification Can Help</strong></p>

      <p>The traditional or old-world approach has always been to
        make use of resources like chemicals, gases and water for the purpose of
        manufacturing and then release them into environment. However, this has only
        led to excessive pollution of our atmosphere over the years. It not only harms
        Mother Earth but also gives rise to a lot of additional expenses. We may be
        ourselves responsible in giving rise to the scarcity of materials and resources
        that we need for our sustenance. This pollution of the environment as well as
        the depletion of resources cannot be good for business nor for mankind. </p>

      <p>Therefore if we are to keep on using the luxuries and comfort that are associated with modern technologies, it
        is
        necessary that we stop using resources in the wrong way and think about the welfare of everyone. We can now
        already
        find developments being made in this field wherein technologies to reduce the environmental wastage are being
        introduced by the brightest minds of the day. Special methods using of <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/">Activated Carbon</a> are being adapted to
        purify
        smoke and gases as well as the liquid effluents before they are released in the environment. The researchers in
        this
        sphere are constantly trying to find out new ways by which production can be improved without harming the
        environment.
        Recycling of resources like fuel, water and chemicals is yet another important goal in their
        agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Adsorption Using
          Activated Carbon For Purification And Recycling </strong></p>

      <p>Adsorption is a process through which the ions, atoms and molecules of a fluid effectively adhere to some solid
        surface so that they can be removed from the fluid. It has been found that Phoenician trading ships dating back
        to
        around 450 BC used charred barrels to store drinking water. This is because the carbon from such barrels can
        attract
        impurities present in the water to the surface and the crew would always get access to purified water. The
        Egyptians
        worked with charcoal for removing bad odors from substances and also heal intestinal problems. </p>

      <p>The main reason for which activated carbon is used for the process of adsorption is that it has the physical
        property
        of microporosity which gives it a substantially large surface area, i.e. around 500 square meters to 1500 square
        meters for one gram. This along with its non-hazardous nature has made it a popular substance for the purpose of
        initiating adsorption. Once the adsorption process has been taken care of, the activated carbon can be exposed
        to a
        stage of desorption which can assist in the recovery or removal of the adsorbed molecules present in its
        surface. The
        activated carbon also requires a very small contact time, i.e. less than 1 second for performing its task. <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">Activated carbon</a> is also extremely effective when it
        comes to
        the
        removal of molecules and impurities or substances that have a rather low weight/volume in the fluid. Hence
        companies
        all over the world choose activated carbon when they need to carry out the adsorption process seamlessly. </p>
