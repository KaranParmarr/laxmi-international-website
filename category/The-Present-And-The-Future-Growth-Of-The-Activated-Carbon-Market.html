    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Generally, activated carbons, which are produced from diverse organic ancestors, such as biomass, polymers,
        coal,
        organic or artificial fibers, etc. , are exposed to carbonization as well as activation processes. Severe
        government
        set of laws for mercury control from power plants, emission control, towering demand for hygienic drinking
        water, as
        well as industrial growth in the Asia Pacific, particularly in ASEAN Countries, drive the <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/">activated carbon</a> market growth throughout the world.</p>

      <img src="/blog/Growth.png" alt="The Present And The Future Growth Of The Activated Carbon Market"
        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

      <p>Due to the active growth, the global
        activated carbon market is expected to reach 8.1 billion US Dollars by 2021 at
        a compound annual growth rate of 9.4%. By volume, the market is likely to grow
        at a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% by 2021. </p>

      <p>There has been increasing use of
        activated carbon in industrial applications. This has led to boost its share in
        the gas phase applications, which is motivating the activated carbon market in
        the Asia-Pacific area. Moreover, activated carbon is widely used in
        pharmaceutical applications as well as in soil remediation applications. </p>

      <p>The active use of the material
        makes it witness considerable growth during the preceding five years. This, in
        turn, will improve the intensification of the activated carbon market in the near
        future. However, shortage of raw material, particularly in Asia-Pacific, is the
        main factor that holds back the growth of the market internationally</p>

      <p>The powder form of activated carbon has been in use throughout the world since 2015. Still, this practice
        continues,
        making the powdered activated carbon the fastest-growing sector in the modern-day market. There is a great
        demand for
        this type of <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/services.html">activated carbon</a> amid
        many
        industries in the world, including pharmaceutical industries to decolorize and deodorize. This active use of the
        substance will create more demand for the powdered form of activated carbon in the future. The business growth
        in
        emerging groups across the world, such as North African Countries, ASEAN countries, Central European countries,
        and
        Eastern European countries, is projected to impel the demand further.</p>

      <p>Another sector of the active use
        of activated carbon is the gas phase application. It is considered the fastest rising
        application sector in the worldwide activated carbon market. This is for the
        reason that the substance is widely used to purify air as well as to remove mercury,
        chlorine, and hydrogen sulfide, paving the way to grow the global market of activated
        carbon. Furthermore, the increasing use of electronic and hybrid cars is likely
        to increase the demand for the activated carbon, as well, in the global automotive
        market.</p>

      <p>Asia-Pacific is considered the fastest-growing activated carbon market in the world in terms of volume and
        value.
        There has been a considerable increase in companies, particularly automobile manufacturing companies, investing
        their
        money in procuring activated carbon.&nbsp; The growing shift of manufacturing facilities in the automotive
        sector to
        the budding economies of the area as well as the strong engineering bases are the main factors contributing to
        the
        development of <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">activated carbon</a> market in the
        world.
        Activated carbon is also actively used in mercury control to purify the air, which shows the way to drive the
        demand
        for activated carbon considerably. </p>
