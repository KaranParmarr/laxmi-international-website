      <p>Do you know how important is activated carbon in our daily life? Well, many of us don’t have any idea about
        this. <a href="https://micbacindia.com/">Activated carbon</a> plays a significant role in today’s life. The
        water you drink
        is purified with the help of this carbon, the air you breathe in is also scrubbed clean with this, the food you
        eat is
        also purified from activated charcoal, the clothes you wear is made with it, you can heal illness with it and
        people
        also go to war with activated charcoal. </p>

      <img src="/blog/Coconut.png" alt="Coconut Shell-based Activated Carbon"
        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

      <p>
      <h2>Activated carbon is extensively used for diverse military,
        scientific and industrial purposes –</h2>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Oil refining</li>
        <li>Bleaching of oil</li>
        <li>Water purification </li>
        <li>Solvent recovery </li>
        <li>Gold and other metal recovery </li>
        <li>Prime ingredient in filters and gas masks that removes
          biochemical or toxic gases</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thus, it is clear that activated carbon is a widely used element
        across the world today. It has extensive use in water purification because its huge
        surface area and high porosity make it an effective absorbent material. Natural
        substances that constitute the base material of activated carbon are – coconut
        shell, wood, peat, anthracite and bituminous coal and lignite. </p>

      <p><strong>
          <h2>Multiple Uses of
            Coconut-shell Based Activated Carbon</h2>
        </strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Majority of micro pores of <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/services.html">coconut shell activated
            charcoal</a> is very small and hence, they are efficient in trapping organic chemical substances like
          organic
          volatile compounds, herbicides, pesticides and tri-halo methane present in drinking water. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Due these micro pores, this carbon has tight
          structure and great mechanical strength thereby providing it with high
          resistance against any kind of wear and tear resulting out of friction. All these
          properties make coconut shell activated carbon best suitable filters for chemical
          and industrial works. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>At the time of small scale as well as large
          scale water purification, coconut shell-based activated charcoal also helps in
          removing impurities and halogens from water. This improves the taste,
          appearance and quality of water. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Finer variety of this carbon, called food grade
          charcoal has utility in varied medical purposes like removal of contaminated
          and poisonous substances from the digestive system of human beings. This
          directly helps in digestion of food. This finer variety of charcoal also plays a
          significant role in kidney and liver dialysis and blood purification. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> You will be surprised to know that <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">activated
          carbon</a> also helps in
        moving mountains, exploring oceans’ depth and furthest point in this universe, makes sparkling nights and cleans
        up
        mistakes that human beings make due to advancement of science. Yet, it is still considered as the “least
        celebrated”
        ingredient in this world. </p>
