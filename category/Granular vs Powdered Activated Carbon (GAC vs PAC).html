        <article class="post-content">
            <p>Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) and Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) serve distinct roles in filtration.
                GAC is formed into larger particles and placed in fixed-bed filters, providing long contact time and
                easy regeneration options. PAC is finely ground, dosed directly into liquids for rapid adsorption and is
                typically removed by clarification or filtration after treatment.</p>

            <p>Designers select GAC when continuous operation and long service cycles are needed, such as municipal
                water polishing or industrial process streams. PAC is preferred for emergency dosing, taste-and-odor
                control spikes, and applications where rapid kinetics matter. Each form has cost and handling trade-offs
                that buyers should evaluate against their treatment goals.</p>

                style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p>Laxmi International supplies both GAC and PAC in multiple grades optimized for water treatment, air
                filtration, and industrial adsorption. Our technical team helps clients run jar tests and pilot trials
                to determine whether a fixed bed GAC system or periodic PAC dosing will deliver the best long-term
                performance and ROI for their specific contaminant profile.</p>

            <p>When planning a filtration upgrade, consider contact time, headloss, regeneration capability, disposal
                costs, and the particulate removal steps required for PAC. With correct selection and support, activated
                carbon—whether granular or powdered—will significantly improve treatment outcomes and operational
                stability.</p>
