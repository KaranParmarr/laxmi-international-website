    <article class="post-content">
      <p>The world is ever changing but, in recent times, this change
        is occurring in a unique manner. Newer services and technologies are emerging every
        year. Now, this evolution, besides having a positive impact on human lives, is
        also increasing consumption of different resources. Consumption is also
        increasing because of growing population in this country. Products have to be
        manufactured in factories and they operate by using resources like fuel, water and
        other kinds of chemicals. </p>

      <p>Now, here arises the problem! Natural resources in India has
        limited supply and wasting of artificial resources leads to pollution and
        hence, to increase in costs. </p>

      <img src="/blog/carbon-lead.png" alt="Can Activated Carbon Lead to a Better Future for Mankind?"
        style="width:100%; height:auto; margin-bottom:15px; border-radius:8px;">

      <p><strong><em>How Significant Purification and Recycling Is</em></strong></p>

      <p>Earlier, people used different resources like gases, chemicals
        and water in manufacturing industries and then released them into the
        environment. This not only polluted the atmosphere but also created an
        imbalance in nature. As a result of this action, scarcity of resources is
        created in the future. This future, with inadequate resources and polluted environment,
        would not be good for businesses or mankind. Therefore, if you wish to enjoy
        the luxuries and comfort of modern technologies, then you have to minimize consumption
        of natural resources and reduce their adverse effect. </p>

      <p>In modern world, technologies and products have already
        started evolving that minimize wastage of resources and lessen the impact of
        waste matter on environment. Industries have also started taking measures for purifying
        liquid wastes, smoke and gases before discharging them. They are also exploring
        new ways for recovering used resources such as chemicals and water. </p>

      <p><strong><em>Role of Activated Carbon in Purification and Recycling</em></strong></p>

      <p>Activated carbon is used for adsorption in recycling and purification. What is adsorption? It is a process
        where
        molecules, ions and atoms in a fluid adhere to some solid surface and are removed from the fluid. Now, why <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/">activated carbon</a> is used in adsorption? It is because of the
        micro
        porosity of activated carbons, which offers large surface area. It is due to non-hazardous nature and vast
        surface
        area of activated carbon that it is used as adsorber in a large scale. </p>

      <p>Another advantage of using activated carbon is, after completing the adsorption process, this carbon can
        undergo
        desorption for recovery or removal of adsorbed molecules from its surface. Moreover, activated carbon requires
        minimum
        contact time for performing its job. As compared to general separating process, <a
          href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/services.html">activated carbon</a> is more effective in
        removing molecules or impurities that have very low weight. </p>

      <p>Advanced technology enables us to use activated form of
        carbon. During its activation process, carbon undergoes several processes for
        enhancing the adsorption capability. Many complex issues can be resolved by utilizing
        activated carbon with advanced purification and filtration equipments. The
        areas where adsorption quality of activated carbon is used – </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Air Purification </li>
        <li>Water Treatment </li>
        <li>Biogas and Natural Gas Purification </li>
        <li>Waste water Treatment </li>
        <li>Automotive Emission Control </li>
        <li>Chemical Purification </li>
        <li>Pharmaceuticals </li>
        <li>Treating Industrial Gases and Smoke </li>
        <li>Food and Beverage </li>
        <li>Vapor Recovery </li>
        <li>Catalyst Recovery </li>
      </ul>

      <p> Now, <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">activated carbon</a> is of three types –
        extruded, granular and powered. You can make the right selection of the carbon after knowing the real nature of
        the
        fluid in which it is to be used. </p>
