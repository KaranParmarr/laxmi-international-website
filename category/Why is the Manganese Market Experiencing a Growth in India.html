    <article class="post-content">
      <p>According to reports from reliable organizations, India is witnessing a growth in demand for manganese, EMD
        (electrolytic <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/">manganese dioxide</a>) and EMM
        (electrolytic manganese metal). Multiple factors have led to the growth in the manganese market in India. Find
        out
        about the top reasons behind this growth. </p>

        style="width:100%; margin:20px 0; border-radius:8px;">

      <p><strong>Rise in the Number of Electric Cars</strong></p>

      <p>With more stress being laid in green energy or eco-friendly
        energy, electric cars are experiencing a huge growth. EMM and EMD are being
        used increasingly in making Lithium ion batteries which are the source of power
        in electric cars as well as other eco-friendly applications. The eco friendly
        energy sector has witnessed many renovations recently, and there is high demand
        for EMD and EMM. With the rechargeable battery market projected to be a 50 USD
        billion industry within the next few years, the growth in demand for high
        quality manganese is easily understandable. </p>

      <p><strong>Demand from the Steel Industry</strong></p>

      <p>EMM and EMD are two extremely refined versions of manganese
        metal. It is also being found that the steel industry needs EMD and EMM in
        large amounts for production and purification purposes. It is expected that the
        demand for these manganese metal versions will rise in the months and years to
        come. The aim is to achieve less impurities and cleaner products, which can
        ensure more purity as well as reduce production time and costs. </p>

      <p>Although crude steel production has slowed down across the
        globe, mainly due to demand for manganese alloys, India is already producing
        more of manganese and is expected to be a global leader in the production and
        supply of the metal in the coming times. Domestic steel production has
        increased and large volumes of manganese are being used across Indian steel
        factories, as well as exported to overseas nations, such as Europe and the US. </p>

      <p><strong>Demand from the Mining Industry</strong> </p>

      <p>Other than the automotive sector, the steel industry and the green energy sector, EMD and EMM are also
        witnessing a
        massive demand in the mining industry in India. Recent research indicates that there is huge potential for
        growth in
        the <a href="https://laxmiinternational.org.in/gallery.html">manganese</a> market due to a higher demand from
        mines across the
        country as well as from other nations of the globe. With new projects expected to begin over the next few years
        in
        Asia, there would be a growth in supply of manganese. Mining organizations are trying to directly negotiate with
        manufacturers and suppliers of this metal. </p>
